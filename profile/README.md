# GDS Local

## GDS Local strengthens collaboration between central and local government to deliver better, more joined-up digital public services.

GDS Local is a new unit within the Government Digital Service (GDS). It has been set up to strengthen collaboration, share learning and innovation between central and local government and improve digital services for citizens and communities across the UK.

GDS Local will work directly with the MHCLG, the LGA and councils to:

- support local authorities to scale digital innovation
- promote shared standards and technology across local and central government
- help make public services simpler, faster and more joined-up
- share knowledge, insights, and best practice across local and central government
- explore new approaches to digital services together
- encourage learning networks to build skills and experience across local and national teams

GDS Local forms part of the GDS [blueprint for a modern digital government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government/a-blueprint-for-modern-digital-government-html) and contributes to plans to build a more productive and agile state.

GDS Local aims to make digital transformation faster, smarter, and more sustainable through better collaboration. This will help people benefit from services that work seamlessly across local and national government.
